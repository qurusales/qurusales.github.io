### Feature ###

+ Unlimited volume per deployment or instance.
+ Use as many images as you require per license at no additional cost
+ Software costs are independent of disk, CPU and cluster sizes
+ The optional integrated API means fast and easy integration to an image workflow environment within your website & digital retail solution.

### Advantage ###

No additional software, license or usage cost as volumes rise beyond the traditional low traffic solutions.  We run up to 20 TB of image data in a single instance.

The is considerably less development effort to integrate QIS than writing image server features from first principles. QIS is priced to ensure that the cost of the license and support is substantially less than the equivalent development costs.

### Benefit ###

Serve all of your images from a fully functioning Image Server for Â£2,000 pa and make significant development savings.
