### Feature ###

+ All of your images are stored and delivered from one place meaning that whatever website they are seen in they remain 100% consistent wherever they are viewed or downloaded.

+ Upload a single high quality image which is then served at exactly the size needed every time.  This works by re-sizing the image at the server every time there is a demand or a zoom request to tiny detail. QIS saves the sized and cropped image in cache every time so that it can be delivered immediately the next time it is requested.

### Advantage ###

The advantage of this approach is that the integrity of your products is protected across multiple pages and multiple sites.  It will appear on any website exactly as you have stored it.  When you updated the image it will automatically be updated everywhere.

Consequently there is no need to upload images more than once. This in turn ensures that your product images are perfect everywhere they appear on every page of every website

Additionally you can use the same source to produce your printed & online catalogues from the same image every time giving perfect consistency.

### Benefit ###

Crucially, because there is no duplication your customers will always see exactly what you intend and you can manage this with simplicity, speed and ease.
