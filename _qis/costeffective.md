### Feature ###

+ Unlimited volume per image server. Unlike any other image server you and your site can use as many images as you like per license with no additional cost. Depending on what servers you are using you may need to allow for more storage but that will not affect the license.

+ Fast and easy for your website developers and marketing team to introduce and maintain the system. In effect they are working in an integrated image workflow environment within your website & digital retail solutions.

### Advantage ###

The key advantages to you are :

No additional software, license or usage cost as volumes rise beyond the traditional low traffic solutions.  Our image server already runs up to 20 TB of image data in a single instance and this could be increased without change to the software.

More economical and faster to integrate QIS than using expensive “off the shelf” services or writing from first principles. QIS is priced to ensure that the cost of the license and support is substantially less than the equivalent development costs.

### Benefit ###

The business benefits of this approach are that  you can serve all of your images from a fully functioning Image Server for £2,000 pa and make significant business savings and direct costs
