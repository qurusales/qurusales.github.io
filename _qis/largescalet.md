### Feature ###

+ Scale horizontally by adding unlimited nodes
+ Scale vertically by adding unlimited resources per node
+ Supported flexible architecture allows deployment across multiple nodes for high availability and high performance
+ Unlimited volume / deployment or instance.
+ No limit to the number of images per license.  
+ No limit to the size of individual images.
+ There is no limit to the size of image database.

### Advantage ###

QIS is capable of delivering performance at massive scale if required and has currently been regularly operationally tested to 20TB of total data comprising over 5,000,000 images served at up to 300,000 images/ hour.  

However, it is also simple to deploy at low scale either as a supporting tactical deployment or an easily integrated feature into low volume applications.

### Benefit ###

QIS only needs to be deployed once irrespective of how big it gets.  Assuming that you have sufficient SysOps capacity, QIS software is designed to underpin deployments that can grow to whatever scale suits your deployment, small or large.
