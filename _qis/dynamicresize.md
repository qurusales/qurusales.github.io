### Feature ###

+ Dynamically re-size images as people look and manipulate them to deliver the perfect size image for your audience in perfect detail every time. This works for instance when people are zooming in for details in a photo.  An example would be the signature on a painting

### Advantage ###

The main advantage of dynamic re-sizing is that images don't need to be sized to pre-determined dimensions such as thumbnails and fixed expanded views.  Instead the images are dynamically re-sized to fit the page or screen size and can be zoomed to the full size of the original image for optimum sharpness and detail.

### Benefit ###

Importantly you are giving your customers the opportunity to see ultimate detail and feel confident to buy online by showing perfect details of every part of every image of every product.
