### Feature ###

+ Responsive image creation in response to browser generated demand
+ API driven resizing
+ Image zooming
+ Slideshow
+ Viewing gallery
+ Full screen  

### Advantage ###

Images do not need to be sized to pre-determined dimensions.  Rather the images will dynamically re-size to fit the page or screen size and can be zoomed to the full size of the original image for optimum sharpness and detail.

This allows flexibility to deliver thumbnails, respond to varying size requests and viewing formats to mobile and desktop devices.

### Benefit ###

Adopting an open source code solution lets you create a better performing environment that uses less bandwidth and delivers faster speeds whilst delivering ultimate detail, showing perfect details of every part of every image of every product.
