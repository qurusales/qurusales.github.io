### Advantage ###

Protects or removes colour profiles depending on the requirement

Tunes image quality against .jpeg & .png file sizes.

Removes image conversion and upload times that allows you to import all images, including legacy images for distribution in modern formats to public and internal operational environments.  

### Benefit ###

Removing the time and effort spent converting hundreds of product images to your deployment. Forget manual conversions, QIS does it for you.
