### Feature ###

+ Dynamically overlay pricing on displayed images.  Through a watermarking process you can overlay prices directly from a pricing table which will then appear with the image wherever it is viewed.

### Advantage ###

Dynamic price overlay allows you to quickly change and control pricing anywhere your images are being displayed.  An example is changing a price on a sale item across your entire digital estate with one simple change.

### Benefit ###

This simple feature ensures that customers see consistent pricing and lets them take advantage of incredibly easy to deploy flash sales.  If you use the server to deliver your product images to your distributors and retailers, it prevents them from displaying inconsistent prices, protecting your brand and leveraging your pricing strategies.
