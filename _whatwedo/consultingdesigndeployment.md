Initially our Solutions team work with companies to identify possible avenues to improve performance and enhance infrastructure.  Secondly, a lead consultant discusses the proposed brief and works to find a solution and final project brief.  Typically we then work both on location or remotely as required.  We are always happy to provide documentation on what we have done.

Typical services that we provide include:

* Database optimisation & high availability
* Firewalls & Security
* Linux optimisation
* Patch Management
* Storage Systems
* Virtualisation & containerisation
