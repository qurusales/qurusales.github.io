Hybrid cloud solutions appear to offer the best of both worlds – IT retain control of data in a private cloud and can utilise public cloud providers that offer a way to buy computing capacity using Opex. However, IT’s enthusiasm to use this technology to demonstrate the capability to be agile and support the organisation is leading to complications.

This Insight white paper explores the challenges that arise when managing hybrid cloud deployments and provides an overview of the way Quru believe IT can take back control of all forms of cloud technology and deliver real value.
