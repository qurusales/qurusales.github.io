heading: "<p>Bonhams is a privately owned British auction house and one of the oldest and largest auctioneers of fine arts and antiques. The Bonhams name is recognised worldwide throughout all sectors of the fine art, antiques and the collectors market, with several departments regarded as world leaders within their specialist category.</p><p>Replacing Windows NT 5.5 was the driver for the deployment of a new global email platform on Linux. In addition, the USA operation had aged servers that were due for re-fresh and, globally, it was proving time-consuming and expensive to manage all the company’s IT assets.</p><p>Bonhams decided to consolidate its global outsourcing contract with Quru and asked the company to find a solution so that it can manage all its assets remotely, thereby delivering an enhanced service to its operations around the world. In addition, it needed to ensure that the company’s Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery strategy and policy were fully supported. .</p>"

<div class="quote"><p><i>&ldquo;We needed to ensure our US operations are fully supported
operationally from an email and also a disaster recovery perspective. We
were also under considerable cost pressure and that combination of
factors was the challenge Quru faced. They came up with an innovative,
practical solution that for the first time gives us an accurate picture of our
assets globally, supports our DR strategy and was delivered at 50% of the
equivalent project undertaken in the UK.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Malcolm Barber, Co-chairman - Bonhams</p></div>
