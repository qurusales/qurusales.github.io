## What are containers?
Linux containers keep applications and their runtime
components together by combining lightweight application
isolation with an image-based deployment method.
Containers introduce autonomy for applications by
packaging apps with the libraries and other binaries on
which they depend. This avoids conflicts between apps that
otherwise rely on key components of the underlying host
operating system (OS). Containers do not contain an OS
kernel, which makes them faster and more agile than virtual
machines. However, it does mean that all containers on a
host must use the same kernel.

## Containers in context
Applications don't always work as expected. One way to
avoid application issues in production is to maintain identical
environments for development, testing, and production.
Another is to create a Continuous Integration environment,
where code is compiled and deployed to test machines and
vetted with each and every code check-in, long before
being pushed to production.
