eightws: Second-vendor <em>virtualisation</em> ready to <em>take advantage</em> of the cloud
summary: Hybrid cloud solutions appear to offer the best of both worlds – IT retain control of data in a private cloud and can utilise public cloud providers that offer a way to buy computing capacity using Opex.

heading: <p>For most companies, virtualization represents an evolving process of achieving greater data centre power and agility. As organisations consider second-vendor virtualization adoption to protect themselves from proprietary costs, open source is being seen as a viable alternative. KVM-based products such as Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization offer lower costs, higher performance, unmatched scalability and the capacity to virtualize mixed Linux / Windows environments.</p><p> This paper explores the journey organisations are taking from single source to multi-vendor virtualization and getting themselves ready to take advantage of the huge business capability opportunities offered by cloud technologies.</p>

## Increased business agility
Virtualization is a key step on the path to increased
technology and business agility and the vast majority of
organisations are using it successfully. However, IT
leaders are increasingly concerned about the cost and
limitations of single-vendor supply.
A survey by IDG Executive Research (Oct 201 1 )
amongst CIO’s and IT Managers, identified
• 41 % expressed concern about single vendor lock-in
• 43% were uneasy about the rising costs of
proprietary, closed source virtualization, the meeting of
SLAs and scalability.

## Vendor diversification
Consequently, it is not a surprise that 51 % of
companies experienced in virtualization are looking at
vendor diversification to ensure high performance
levels.
And when they look at second source vendors, they
choose open-source. Why? Well it is generally
acknowledged that the functionality of Linux-based,
open source virtualization is equal to that of proprietary
solutions, delivering increased scalability, high
performance and interoperability. In addition open
virtualization solutions cost less than half as much as a
closed source proprietary alternative
