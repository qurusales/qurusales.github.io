Increase of 31 % on ‘Out-of-the-Box’ performance (pgbench)  
'Tuned' delivers 99% performance increase (pgbench)  
and 52% performance gain (HammerDB)

We believe that new vendor offerings should be tested in order to identify the opportunities for fine-tuning to increase performance and reduce costs, especially when they challenge established players and technology such as Oracle and Intel x86.

This White Paper summarises the results Quru achieved in performance benchmark tests running PostgreSQL on IBM Power vs x86. Quru has worked with IBM to optimise PostgreSQL on IBM Power and we proved that its ‘out-of-the-box’ performance can be beaten and that we can significantly beat x86 – the result is an open source based solution that increases the performance and reduces the cost of managing databases.

A technical paper on how this was done is also available.
