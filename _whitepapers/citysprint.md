## Delivering to SLAs
Service is paramount in this high volume business and if the agreed SLAs are not achieved, it can
impact customer relationships and revenues. Client deliveries are matched to the couriers using a
mix of human knowledge, a team of Controllers, and specialist software called Fleet Mapper. An
upgrade to the software was combined with a need to increase the reliability of the
infrastructure – the database was not as reliable as it should have been, which made the
controllers' jobs more difficult and had an impact on operational efficiency.
