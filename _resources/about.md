Quru was established in 2008 as an innovative design and development house.  

In the last 10 years there have been huge changes in software application development including the rise of mobile, the acceleration of enterprise adoption of open source technologies and the emergence of cloud.  

We are now actively working with secure private cloud , distributed ledger (blockchain) and machine learning/ AI technologies to help our clients remain well ahead of their competitors.

The company is headed by its founder Roland Whitehead.
