Over 5 years Quru has collaborated with global cloud infrastructure company A24 on a number of projects but has now cemeted it's relationship by divesting it highly regarded, award winning open source subscription and consulting business to A24.   A24â€™s business is fully aligned to open source and they will bring global resources to take the business to its next stage.

Over the past 8 years Quru has built a very successful open-source business supplying subscriptions to many of the UK's most innovative businesses and academic institutions, as well as helping them make the most of their open-source solutions by delivering consultation on their use and deployment. Quru is increasingly focussed on its roots in software development and will now accelerate development of open-source solutions of its own and on the development of bespoke enterprise solutions for its clients.

A24 was formed in 2006 in Tokyo, Japan to provide best in class cloud based IT infrastructure solutions. Today A24 is headquartered in London with global clients using data-centres spanning 4 continents. By managing solutions from client's internal network devices, through dedicated infrastructure and services provided by major cloud providers, A24 is able to provide the ultimate managed solution. A24 is no stranger to open-source solutions, running many thousands of compute devices using open-source software. By acquiring this business, A24 will be able to ensure that its clients have access to the best advice, consulting and subscriptions and will continue to work to grow this very valuable sector of the IT industry.

Quru and A24 have collaborated on a number of projects over the past 5 years. Between them they transitioned international fine art auctioneers Bonhams to a cloud based solution and have developed a radical visual infrastructure management solution that they will be continuing to work on together.
