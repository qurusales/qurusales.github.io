heading: "<p>Performance monitoring is a vital aspect of ensuring IT, especially new technology, is delivering what is expected and, critically, what the business needs to deliver a high quality end-user experience. As organisations take advantage of new container technology within a full stack, we’re finding that many are unclear as to what they need to invest to achieve the performance they need – especially as they scale.</p><p>In our experience, Coscale is an outstanding monitoring platform that enables organisations to rapidly right-size a full stack container and microservices production environment. Feedback from our customer’s is very positive and they say the software is easy to deploy, the user-interface is well designed and easy to use.</p>"

## Container-native monitoring

When building a container environment, there are two main priorities. First, be able to right-size the environment to cost-effectively meet an organisation’s needs and, secondly to avoid wasting time on false alerts. 

Clearly, when first setting up a container environment, you won’t know the performance you are going to need and because you don’t have any historical data to work from, you cannot undertake capacity planning. Coscale delivers the performance monitoring data that enables you to rapidly gain this insight and right-size your environment. 

It sounds obvious, but a key question is deciding what to monitor and how to set appropriate thresholds. Each organisation is different and it’s vital to build knowledge of the way it works, i.e. if there are peaks and troughs of performance, you need to know if that peak is a problem or it’s something that happens regularly for a specific reason. 

## Built in machine learning & anomaly detection

Coscale have built machine learning within an anomaly detection engine into their platform.  This means that it learns over time what is a real alert and delivers a much clearer picture of what is going on in the container and micros-services environment. You set performance thresholds that match business aims and focus only on alerts for things that are genuinely important. In addition, it monitors webpage load speeds and provides insight into what is happening in real-life and the impact on the end-user experience. 

We use Coscale to help clients ‘right-size’ their container environments, scale as needed and avoid false alerts. This means they accelerate container deployments in production with confidence and gain metrics that guide them on how to achieve the performance the business needs.
