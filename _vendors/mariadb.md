Data volumes in key business systems are constantly growing. This increases the pressure on the applications used to supply personalised data from these systems to end-users.

## MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL ##

It is perfectly suited to help with any organisations’ data needs. MariaDB is now available in the software repositories of all leading Linux distributions including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, Centos, Debian and Ubuntu.

## MariaDB: The Database heart of Turbo Lamp ##

A high-performance, open source database has been a core component of the LAMP stack since it originated with MySQL back in the 1990s. MySQL was pioneering in delivering a developer-friendly, easily deployed relational database well-suited to the demands of the web.

Today’s applications need a highly reliable database that can handle multi-terabyte data volumes and millions of users, while guaranteeing transactional integrity and continuous availability. So, naturally, the Turbo LAMP stack features MariaDB, the direct descendent of MySQL, as its core data management solution

MariaDB is application-compatible with MySQL, so existing applications work. With a vendor independent community at the heart of its development and many of the original inventors of MySQL still actively involved, MariaDB is a more advanced implementation of the world’s most widely adopted RDBMS technology.

Many of the most famous web-based companies make extensive use of MariaDB in their infrastructure. Now with Turbo LAMP and POWER8 technology, this mature database delivers cost-effective data management of the latest mission-critical business applications.
