heading: "Docker has led the container revolution and its leading technology has been incorporated into many competitive products. </p><p>Historically, server virtualization represented a major step forward, enabling consolidation of workloads from multiple applications to run on the same hardware. However, virtual server instances still require deployment of individual operating systems, the application and the workload. Multi-tier applications that don't work well together need to be deployed in separate virtual machines, separately managed, monitored and backed-up. Containers enable applications to be held in much smaller packages that share an underlying Operating System, which is more efficient.</p><p>Docker has the flexibility to accommodate combinations of Windows and Linux based container deployments across multiple operating systems.

## What Docker say

Docker provides container software that is ideal for developers and teams experimenting with container-based applications. Docker Desktop provides an integrated container-native development experience; it launches as an application from your Mac or Windows toolbar and provides access to the largest library of community and certified Linux and Windows content from Docker Hub. 

Docker Enterprise eliminates risk by enabling you to start big or small, with legacy or new applications, using any operational model, on any OS, across any infrastructure, whether it be on prem or across multiple clouds with the same Docker experience throughout.

It unifies processes across any architecture, while aligning with existing IT operations so organizations can get applications to market faster, reduce TCO and ease the adoption of new technology as business needs evolve over time. 

Enterprise incorporates security at every step of the application delivery lifecycle without getting in your way or adding extra cost. Applications receive greater protection while maintaining performance, improving governance and enabling policy-driven automation.

Docker originated in a Linux world but delivers the capability to deploy containers on Windows, and Linux variants including Red Hat, SuSe and Ubuntu. Companies that use both Windows and Linux or that are moving towards increased use of Linux, are able to gain the same benefits of agility, scale and resiliency for workloads on both platforms in a hybrid environment.

Docker therefore gives developers and SysOps the freedom to build, manage and secure business-critical applications without the fear of technology or infrastructure lock-in.

## Point of view
<i>&ldquo;The Docker Enterprise container platform provides 300% faster time to market; 40% reduction in cost via better server utilization and lower licensing costs; 70% increase in resolving customer issues. The combination of reduced costs and getting new solutions to market faster is something that our clients can’t ignore.&rdquo;</i>
