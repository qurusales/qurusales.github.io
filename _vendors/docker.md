Docker provides an integrated technology suite that enables development and IT operations teams to build, ship, and run distributed applications anywhere.

Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same on any computer, on any infrastructure and in any cloud.

Agility - Docker gives developers the freedom to define environments, create and deploy applications faster and easier, and the flexibility for IT to respond to change.

Control - Docker enables developers to own all the code from infrastructure to application and IT to standardize, secure and scale the operating environment.

Portability - Docker gives you choice without complexity, from a laptop to a team, to private infrastructure and public cloud providers.

## Open and secure

Docker containers are based on open standards and run on all major Linux distributions and Microsoft operating systems with support for every infrastructure.

In addition, if containers are running on a single machine, they all share the same operating system kernel so they start instantly and make more efficient use of RAM. Images are constructed from layered filesystems so they can share common files, making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient. Critically, containers isolate applications from each other and the underlying infrastructure thereby providing an added layer of protection for the application.

## Accelerate development

Save time by using Docker to take copies of your live environment and run them on any new endpoint running Docker. Also, because applications are isolated, developers can use the best language and tools for their needs without worrying about using ‘approved’ language stacks and tooling.

By packaging up the application with its configs and dependencies and shipping as a container, the application will always work as designed locally, on another machine, in test or production. No more worries about having to install the same configs into a different environment, Docker creates a common framework for developers and sysadmins to work together on distributed applications and dynamically change applications - adding new capabilities, scaling out services or resolving any issues.

Docker’s research has found that users on average ship x7 more software after deploying Docker in their environment, thereby delivering more value to customers faster. If you want to help your DevOps team be even more productive, let’s talk about how Docker can help your business.
