heading: "<p>There are two major open source database solutions â€“ MySQL and PostgreSQL. The choice depends on how an application has been designed alongside design preferences. Where the intelligence to manage data is built into the database rather than the application then PostgreSQL is the usual solution.</p><p>We recommend EnterpriseDB for PostgreSQL as the organisation that demonstrates the deepest PostgreSQL knowledge and who are responsible for over 50% of the posted code changes. We&rsquo;ve trialled many open source databases and believe that for PostgreSQL, EnterpriseDB is the best solution.  It enables organisations to migrate their data rapidly and cost-effectively and from a technical and business perspective, our organisations have a very close working relationship at all levels.</p><p>The benefits our clients achieve are significant - EnterpriseDB enables you to run PostgreSQL at scale. We are regularly asked by organisations to help them move away from Oracle, attracted by the opportunity to reduce database costs by 80% or more.</p>"

  - quote: We needed to increase the reliability of our infrastructure to support the client and courier database, which is a business-critical resource. Any issues with the database cost us money and could damage our brand reputation. Quru has demonstrated an in-depth understanding of the way our business works and have enabled us to significantly increase the reliability of our infrastructure. The mix of technical consultancy and implementation has been excellent and we consider them a trusted partner.

## High availability enterprise database

EnterpriseDB has taken PostgreSQL and developed a full range of enterprise functionality. PostgreSQL is specifically designed for the enterprise environment - it has built-in capability to scale with agility and resiliency. 

EDB Postgres Ark provides a unified UI (graphical and API) to control and manage deployments across multiple platforms from a single management console that you manage and control. EDB Postgres Ark deployments are highly available, have integrated disaster recovery, cross-platform replication (database, provider and geo), self-healing capabilities and with EDB Postgres make migrations a snap. EDB Postgres Ark gives IT managers the ideal combination of deployment flexibility combined with centralized control and monitoring while providing developers point and click simplicity, flexibility and speed when developing and deploying applications.

Migrating from one database or platform to another can be a time-consuming, complex exercise, making it essential to select highly compatible products that can reduce both the time and costs involved.
