heading: "<p>Confidence in backup and disaster recovery solutions is critical. When backing up Linux environments it is better to utilise purpose built tools.  The alternatives are expensive,  inefficient and potentially risky, especially in virtual deployments.</p><p>We have been unable to source a satisfactory solution in the market, and have therefore worked with Red Hat and SEP to develop appropriate capabilities to backup a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation (RHV) environment.</p><p>SEP sesam is technology developed for a specific purpose that has made SEP the fastest growing backup solution for Linux workloads. Today, SEP has the largest portfolio of support for Linux workloads with jointly developed backup solutions for Red Hat and EDB. It offers hybrid backup with one management console to support Linux-based products from Red Hat, EDB, MySQL as well as proprietary vendors including Microsoft, VMware and Oracle. It covers Enterprise Backup & Disaster Recovery, Deduplication and Archiving.</p>"

## Secure enterprise backups

SEP sesam is ideal for every IT-environment. From small businesses up to major enterprises, SEP sesam supports all common operating systems, virtualization platforms, applications, databases and storage technologies. Secure enterprise-wide backups, restores, and disaster recoveries are extremely fast and easy to implement and to perform. SEP sesam’s multi-streaming technology allows simultaneous backups of an unlimited number of servers. The result is maximum speed performing restore-oriented backups.

By implementing the newest deduplication feature, storage capacities and network loads can be substantially minimized. Block-level replication of deduplicated data between datacenters is very effective.

SEP sesam is specialized in hot backups of applications, databases and files in multi-OS environments.
