## What Canonical say

Ubuntu is an open source software operating system that runs from the desktop, to the cloud, to all your internet connected things
On desktops Ubuntu looks good and works better than any other Linux deployment.

In cloud environments it delivers stability at minimal cost whilst delivering latest technology releases as they become available.  It is also the platform that reliably supports applications developed for cloud deployment.  Cloud providers offer and support eh Ubuntu operating system more prevalently than any other and it is frequently the first choice in the cloud.
