## Avoid unexpected outages ##

Nagios provides enterprise-class Open Source IT, network, server and application monitoring. The company’s offering consists of technologies that enable identification and resolution of IT infrastructure problems before they affect critical business processes.

* Nagios XI monitors all mission-critical infrastructure components on any operating system. 
* Nagios Log Server aggregates and consolidates log data from various sources and combines it with monitoring data. Root cause analysis helps you leverage what the data is telling you. 
* Nagios Fusion fuses multiple instances of XI and Core (the monitoring engine at the heart of Nagios) to provide a centralized monitoring view.
* Network Analyser provides a detailed performance analysis of WAN and LAN connections to help optimise network utilisation.

Scalable and flexible, Nagios ensures that business processes won’t be affected by unknown outages and your organisation keeps working and delivering its services to its customers.
