heading: "<p>Aqua Security provides companies running Docker containers a level of vulnerability management, security and control, that equates to best practice  Enterprise solutions for physical/virtual servers, until now not available on Linux.</p><p>In practical terms this provides visibility of vulnerabilities that could exist across your container estate.  In addition Aqua Securities delivers rich security and policy management tools, including the ability to whitelist commands and processes that can run inside a container.  The enforcement of policy and baseline, which serves to prevent injection attacks, ensures a real and tangible layer of security for container based deployments from internal and external threats. </p><p>Add to this “secret” management and Aqua establishes itself as a robust security platform for containers.</p>"
quotes:
  - quote: "At Quru we use Aqua Security&rsquo;s solution because it brings benefits to Docker containers that businesses have long expected from their server deployments. Traditionally Linux operating systems have not been associated with the same risks and vulnerabilities as Windows, and hence have not been associated with security software. However, this ignores other risks, particularly those of rule transgression and of malicious internal or external hackers. Aqua Security significantly diminishes those risks."

## Aqua Security

Aqua Security was founded by IT security veterans from companies including Intel Security, CA Technologies, and Imperva.

With containers being the next major disruption in datacenter and application technology, Aqua recognized that containerized environments create new challenges in security, but also present an opportunity to reinvent application security – more effectively and more efficiently than ever. Aqua Security enables enterprises to secure their virtual container environments from development to production, accelerating container adoption and bridging the gap between DevOps and IT security. Aqua’s Container Security Platform provides full visibility into container activity, allowing organisations to detect and prevent suspicious activity and attacks in real time. Integrated with container lifecycle and orchestration tools, the Aqua platform provides transparent, automated security while helping to enforce policy and simplify regulatory compliance.

Aqua was founded in 2015 and is backed by TLV Partners, Microsoft Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners and individual IT security leaders. It is based in Israel and San Francisco.
