heading: <p>High costs and vendor lock-in from proprietary vendors force many companies to adopt a dual hypervisor strategy. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses open source to effectively support this strategy.</p><p>We believe that RHV is the preferred alternative to VMware in the key areas of cost, performance, functionality, scalability and interoperability. We recognise that Linux workloads can be run on VMware and Microsoft&rsquo;s Hyper-V, but are confident that Linux workloads run better using Red Hat Virtualization because of the full integration of the Linux stack.</p>
quotes:
  - quote: Following countless deployments, we have great confidence in RHV. It delivers the benefits our clients expect from virtualization with top performance, scalability, no vendor lock-in and up to 80% lower licensing costs.

## The only enterprise-ready, fully open-source virtualization management solution.

**Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization**

Virtualization provides a layer between computer hardware and the software running on it; the hyper-visor. As a result, multiple operating systems and solution stacks can run simultaneously on a single machine. Virtualization delivers measurable benefits: server consolidation, hardware abstraction, increased utilization, enhanced manageability and agility.
