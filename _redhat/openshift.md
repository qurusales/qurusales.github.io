## The Kubernetes platform for big ideas

Red Hat OpenShift is the container management market leader, particularly through its capability to scale. Itâ€™s an award-winning platform that easily enables you to quickly develop and manage new applications in nearly any infrastructure, public or private, whether on-premise, in a public cloud or hosted. In particular, those using Agile methodologies are finding it easier and more time-efficient to manage containers through Red Hat OpenShift.

The technology incorporates Enterprise Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Additionally, OpenShift works anywhere that Red Hat Enterprise Linux is deployed and supported. This enables enterprises to deploy hybrid solutions on Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VMware, and more.
 
It supports DevOps by providing development and operations teams with a common platform and tools that enable better workflows.
