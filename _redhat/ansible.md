heading: "<p>Most enterprises use a hybrid mix of Windows and Linux to meet changing business demands. Systems that are already hard to deploy and maintain lead to serious management and cost implications for IT teams.</p><p>We recommend Ansible automation tools to manage large scale configuration across the entire IT estate, especially in large enterprise environments. </p><p>Ansible Tower is the enterprise version and delivers a simple to use GUI and full Red Hat support.  A key Ansible Tower feature is Workflow which uses conditions in playbooks to create logical workflow automation and rollback to a known &ldquo;good state&rdquo;.</p><p>Quru manages its own infrastructure and software deployment via Ansible including management of Quru Image Server (QIS), configuration of secure Linux, PostgreSQL and query, downloading and installation of GitHub packages.</p>"

  - quote: We regularly deliver consulting services to companies without sufficient internal capacity to deploy Ansible in hybrid environments. We like Ansible Playbooks because they create order and keep applications properly deployed and managed throughout their entire lifecycle.

## Simplifying server and device configuration
Ansible Tower is a web-based solution that makes Ansible even more easy to use for IT teams of all kinds. It’s designed to be the hub for all of your automation tasks.

Red Hat® Ansible® Tower helps you scale IT automation, manage complex deployments and speed productivity. Centralize and control your IT infrastructure with a visual dashboard, role-based access control, job scheduling, integrated notifications and graphical inventory management. And Ansible Tower's REST API and CLI make it easy to embed Ansible Tower into existing tools and processes.

Ansible Tower allows you to control access to who can access what, even allowing sharing of SSH credentials without someone being able to transfer those credentials. Inventory can be graphically managed or synced with a wide variety of cloud sources. It logs all of your jobs, integrates well with LDAP, and has an amazing browsable REST API. Command line tools are available for easy integration with Jenkins as well. Provisioning callbacks provide great support for autoscaling topologies.
