**Red Hat Satellite 6**

*Cutting the time and cost of managing your Red Hat estate*

Systems Management is a critical responsibility for IT personnel who are already under pressure. Increasingly complex environments, in particular private, public and hybrid clouds are difficult to manage and require more admin time which leads to higher costs.


Red Hat Satellite 6 is a great tool for simplifying and improving the management of your Red Hat estate. It's an easy-to-use single management console built on innovative, open source technologies and it enables the effective and compliant management of Red Hat systems. It delivers major benefits:

* Simplification. Reduces the number of management tools needed to build, deploy, run and retire systems by increasing automation and streamlining the processes involved
* Scalability. Manages a large number of geographically distributed systems, across a wide variety of platforms from physical to virtual, as well as private and public clouds
* Lifecycle management. Provides a single Content View of both software and configuration content and helps improve end-to-end system lifecycle management
* Patch management. Uses a centralised platform to ensure all server deployments are patched with the latest security fixes, bug fixes and product enhancements. What’s more, you can test patches before you deploy them in your live environment

New capabilities
