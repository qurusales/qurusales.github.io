## Single management console for streamling Red Hat updates

Increasingly complicated environments, in particular private, public and hybrid clouds are difficult to manage and require more time from skilled managers. When it comes to your Linux estate, the way to cut through this is to deploy Red Hat Satellite 6. It’s an easy-to-use single management console built on innovative, open source technologies and it enables the effective and compliant management of Red Hat systems.

Red Hat Satellite 6 simplifies system management by automating and streamlining processes. It is scalable across geographically distributed systems and multiple platforms, physical to virtual as well as private and public clouds. It provides a single Content View of both software and configuration content and helps improve end-to-end system lifecycle management. In addition, it uses a centralised platform to ensure all server deployments are patched with the latest security fixes, bug fixes and product enhancements. Patches can be tested before you deploy them in your live environment.

In addition, Red Hat Insights proactively predicts and prevents potential problems before they occur.
