## Blink EDM

Blink Electronic Document Management was designed, implemented, and is still supported by Quru since its first launch in 2008. This web-based application provides an electronic document archive and search facility, along with automatic document indexing from barcodes and 3rd party databases, a workflow system, and unattended imports from email, web, shared folders and scanners. It is highly customisable in terms of user permissions, workflow and document categorisation, to suit a wide range of businesses and use cases.

BlinkEDM has been deployed in a variety of different companies across the US, where users have praised its easy-to-use interface and consistent performance. Several sites are still running Blink in production after 10 years, with trouble-free document archives that run to many millions of documents.
