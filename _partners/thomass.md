heading: <p>Thomas&rsquo; are one of London&rsquo;s leading independent preparatory school groups with schools in Battersea, Clapham, Fulham and Kensington with a growing kindergarden. With ever increasing demand on the best school places for children keeping the schools and their teachers busy, parents really want to know what is going on in the simplest, quickest way.</p><p>Following the demise of their old parent communications system (which would not have coped with today&rsquo;s requirement), Thomas&rsquo;s did a study of available solutions before deciding that a new solution from Quru would best fulfil their needs.</p>
