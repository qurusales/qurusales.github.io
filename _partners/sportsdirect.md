## Consultancy

Quru has provided Sports Direct with consultancy and training on the implementation of Red Hat Satellite 6 to enable the introduction of standardised operating environments at Sports Direct, as well as to provide timely patching in a controlled and repeatable manner.

This has been supplemented with the implementation of Ansible and AWX to enable automation of mundane tasks, increasing productivity and reducing the risk of unplanned downtime.
