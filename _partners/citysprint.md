## Design, Develop, Deliver

Quru has been responsible since 2008 for designing and implementing high availability database systems at CitySprint, as well as supporting their on-going maintenance and upgrade cycles. 

We have since supplemented these with monitoring systems to provide near realtime visibility of service health and performance, the introduction of standardised operating environments through Red Hat Satellite 6, and implementing bespoke SELinux policies to ensure the security and integrity of CitySprints valuable proprietary codebase in the age of GDPR.

## Consultancy

Quru are CitySprint's open source consultative partner of choice and we are proud to support them in their key business decisions regarding their use and implementation of Open Source architecture, enabling them to leverage the benefits of Open Source whilst achieving their business targets.
