## Design, develop and deliver
Since 2007 Quru have been providing software design, development and delivery services for it's internal auction management as well as for it's public facing solutions.

A<sup>3</sup> is widely regarded as the best international, multi-company, multi-currency auction management system and Quru took on responsibility for it's design and development when Quru was first started.

Quru has worked with brand/web agencies Sequence, Identity and, most recently, Albion, to produce different versions of Bonhams public website and other web tools. Bonhams were the first auction house to offer live, realtime bidding using a standard web browser and have lead the way with zoomable, colour managed imagery and other web developments.

## End user support
Bonhams staff have a single number to call and single address to email for all IT support issues. Quru provide a high level of experience in running services for Bonhams and ensuring that end users both understand their processes as well as their systems.

## System administration
With over 60 years of auction system administration experience between then, Quru provide un-paralleled skills and knowledge in how to keep auctions running in the digital age with just enough resources and at the right cost. Now working with partners [A24](/partners/a24.io.html), Quru are responsible for the implementation of servers, services, WANs and LANs for Bonhams globally.
